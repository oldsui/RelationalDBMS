2. Internal Record Format
- Show your record format design and describe how your design satisfies O(1) field access. If not, just mention that you haven't implemented this feature.
    Offset of each field is stored in each record, so O(1) field access is realized.

    Record header format:

        short(2-byte)       short           short                   short           
        |fieldCount| field_0 offset | field_1 offset |...| field_n-1 offset| 
    
    Record data format:
    
                                int(4-byte)       char(1-byte) 
        TypeVarChar:            |varCharLen | char1 | char2 | char3 | char4 |....|
                                
                                  int/float (4-byte)
        TypeInt/TypeReal:       |   int/float   |
    

- Describe how you store a VarChar field.
    Already explained in the section above: length of char array + char array


3. Page Format
- Show your page format design
    
    Page header(96-byte): pageNumber(unsigned), recordCount(short), freeSpace(short), offset(short), misc[86] for future use.
    data[4000]

    data[4000] is organized as:
        record_0, record_1, ..., record_n,
        free space,
        slot_n, slot_n-1, ..., slot_0

    slot_i format:
        offset(short): starting address of record_i
        length(short): length of this record_i

4. Implementation Detail
- Other implementation details goes here.
    a. nullIndicator: each byte is extracted first, then use a bit mask to determine if a field is NULL;
    b. insert a record:
        compose an inner record from the API record, returns recordSize
        given the size of the inner record, find the location to insert it, returns rid, offset
        read the page out into memory
        compose slot
        write the inner record and slot into the page
        write the page into file

    c. read a record:
        allocate a piece of memory, read the inner record to it, compose an API record from the inner record


5. Other (optional)
- Freely use this section to tell us about things that are related to the project 1, but not related to the other sections (optional)
